Waiting...
For Blocklauncher to update.

How it Works:
Run MCPE-Remote.exe on your PC.

Add the script to your ModPE favorite script.
CMD commands:
"\start"
"\stop"
Inside the ModPE script you can add your favorite mods
and you can Enable/disable them from PC using keyboard.
By default MCPE-Remote.exe will forward all keyboard messages
to Blocklauncher. You can edit the script to change keyboard settings.
