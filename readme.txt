Waiting...
For Blocklauncher to update.

How it Works: [ Phone and PC must be connected to the same network ]
Run MCPE-Remote.exe on your PC.
1.Input the Phone IP.
2.Click [ Start ]
3.The App will stop only when the Player leaves the game.

Add the script to your ModPE.
CMD commands:
"\start"
"\stop"
Inside the ModPE script you can add your favorite mods
and you can Enable/disable them from PC using keyboard.
By default MCPE-Remote.exe will forward all keyboard messages
to Blocklauncher. You can edit the script to change keyboard settings.

MOUSE SETTINGS:
1.Set LeftClick for PutBlock and RightClick for DestroyBlock.
2.Set LeftClick:   SingleClick for PutBlock.
                   LongClick for DestroyBlock.
      RightClick:  AutoClick.
3.Middle-Click:  Teleports you behind walls or UP&DOWN
                 example: You have an underground room
                          Just look down and CLICK to get in.
                          Look up and CLICK to get out.
                      


KEYBOARD FEATURES:
1.High jump
2.Speed
3.SlowFalling
4.Third person view( like controllers do)
5.Hide/Show GUI.

MY FAVORITE FEATURES THAT I CAN NOT SHARE:
1.Flying ( online servers )
2.Find Players and save Coords, after the player leaves the game,
               calculates the distance and the shortest path to follow.
3.Hunter:      AimBot+TeleportBehindEnemy+AutoClick( ideal for PVP)
4.Scanner:     Find underground empty spaces(A simple Map with DOTS and LINES)
